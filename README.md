# Arduino Robot Car Control

## Overview
This Arduino repository contains scripts outlining the movement objectives of a robot car, incorporating various sensors such as ultrasonic sensors, IR sensors, line detection sensors, and more. Each script defines motor and infrared sensor pins, along with functions for forward, backward, left, right, and other movements.

## Purpose
I developed these scripts out of my fascination with robots and their ability to perform physical tasks autonomously. I find robots incredibly fun to work with, especially when they take the form of physical automation. 

This project explores the realm of robotics with the implementation of various sensors, testing their location, effectiveness, and interaction with the environment.

## Robot Specs
- 4 wheels
- Programmed with Arduino
- Language is C++
